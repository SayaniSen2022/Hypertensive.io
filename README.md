### Inspiration
I was inspired to build this application watching a friend suffer from hypertension induced anxiety attacks. The continuous stress of living with a chronic condition and dependency on medicines from a young age led to  health related anxiety which further worsened the condition. It was a vicious cycle and a daily struggle.

One thing we noticed in that period, that meticulously keeping redord of bp-data and being aware of the fact that medicines having a positive impact on health helped in reducing anxiety to a large extent. It was like being on top of game and knowing for sure that things are going well inside the body.

Thus came the idea to build our very own solution and maybe help those people in the process, who suffer from same kind of health induced anxiety and struggle on a daily basis.

P.S.: My friend is perfectly fine now and is a fellow developer. This application is his brainchild and I am contributing on the frontend.
